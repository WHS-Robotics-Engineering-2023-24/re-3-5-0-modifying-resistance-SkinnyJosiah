## Circuit 1 

This circuit had 2 grounds, so 2 circuits. one with 330 ohm of resistance and one with 470 ohms.
More restistance = Slower (Less) Current. 
This is shown as the 330 ohms resistor had a faster current (15.15) compared to 470. (10.64)

## Circuit 2 

Circuit two used resistors in a series to essentially combine ohms. It combined the 330 and 470 ohms resistors to make an 800 ohm resistance.

The current here was much slower than the first 2 circuits, at 6.25 mA.

## Circuit 3 

This circuit had 15.15 mA of current for the 330 ohms resistor, and 10.64 mA for the 470 ohms resistor. The current is split up between the two then come back together to make a total
of 25.79 mA of current through the GND wire.
